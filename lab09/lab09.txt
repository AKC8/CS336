9.1
a. The bundling does not do much for a project of this size. Since the dist directory only has a few items inside I don't think webpack is that valuable for small projects. For larger things I can see it be useful
b. Webpack takes React and JavaScript into ES5 so browsers work
c. You can't load the file locally. Bundle.js can't be found because the path is not relative to the location of the directory.
d. Webpack preprocesses jsx files so that the browser can read the code.

9.2
a. index.html is larger than before we changed the dist directory
b. Requests are simpler becuase libraries and dependencies are in one place. Things can be done in one request instead of multiple
c. index.html and bundle.js are the only ones loaded. styles file is a string in bundle.js which is simpler

9.3
a. Changes to the SPA are reflected in the localhost:3001  because it is refreshed with the new bundle and index files. These changes do not appear for localhost:3000
b. Webpack can be useful depending on the project. It seems like a very small change for the amount of space saved and there was not much convenience in bundling everything. I can see for other environments it would be better to use Webpack.
